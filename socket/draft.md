# Introduction to Socket Programming and Raw Implementation in Java and JavaScript

Socket programming is a very important concept in computer science. It provides a full-duplex connection between the client and the server and often uses event-based communication with third-party libraries like Socket.io to handle data transmission in production code.

Understanding how raw sockets operate under the hood is inevitable as it's a crucial step in initiating an HTTP request aside with direct use in a lot of other important use cases like chat services, games, and any service that needs simultaneous communication.

In this article, I explained raw socket programming without using any third-party libraries like Socket.io, just raw socket implementations in both Java and JavaScript.
